First I imported promptSync to take inputs, I have used the e6 version, Its hard to import it in a common js file you have to edit a json file
{
  "name": "tdl",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Tools for next project TDL",
  "main": "Start.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "TStart.js"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "To Do List with extra features"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "TDLE"
  ],
  "author": "Yash Raj",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "chalk": "^5.0.1",
    "ejs": "^3.1.6",
    "express": "^4.17.3",
    "promise": "^8.1.0",
    "prompt-sync": "^4.2.0"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
type module one

then only u can work smoothly
I imported chalk npm... for colors

To make the code clean I used constant variables to store string values

Later I took inputs and used those string values

I made two classes with the same method(method overloading 10 days to fix on my own..)
the error was the object getting printed out in a weird format, very annoying.

I used for loop, to take  inputs(just change i<2) for taking multiple values

I inserted in if-else for the different tasks to remind 

I made a function Alert where I used method overloading and for each

Ahat follows next is if-else 

After that setTimeout function to remind from now

setTimeout(TimingAlert, DurationT) is the time taken to execute after the start, as a particular time from now.

Enjoy!
